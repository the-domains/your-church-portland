I've never been one to talk about my everyday life all over the interwebs, but I've been on the hunt for a new job as my current one has turned sour.

Maybe someone we love hurt us, financial struggles are passed down through the family, or someone else's bad decisions have a direct effect on us. But there's good news - your current location doesn't determine who you are. Whether you have a good job or a crummy job, whether you have a fully funded savings account or $3 cash in your pocket, you can decide to not make excuses. You can decide to not be a victim.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="43"><p>This is was the case for a guy in the Bible, in 2 Samuel chapter 9, named Mephibosheth. For a fun summer activity, try saying Mephibosheth 5 times fast with a mouth full of marshmallows. Mephibosheth was the son of David's best friend, Jonathan, and the grandson of King Saul. One particular day, while King Saul and Jonathan were out fighting the Philistines, they were killed within hours of each other. The Philistines then turned to the city, which prompted Mephibosheth's caretaker to grab him and get out of town. On their way out, the caretaker completely drops Mephibosheth and breaks both of his legs. Talk about a bad day. In a matter of hours, your grandfather and father die, and then someone busts both of your legs on accident.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="44"><p>Fast forward years later and we find Mephibosheth in exile, in a city called Lo Dabar. It literally means, 'no pasture.' Lo Dabar no longer exists in modern Israel, but this is where it used to be located:</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="45"><p>Majestic, isn't it?</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="46"><p>So Mephibosheth is living out the rest of his life in this wasteland, both of his legs busted, when one day, he hears a knock on the door. It's King David's army, and I'm sure he's thinking David is going to pay him back brutally for the hardship Saul caused David. Once he arrives in Jerusalem, he finds quite the opposite. King David informs him that all the land that used to belong to Saul is now his. What's more, he gets to eat at David's table every night for the rest of his life. He even gives him Saul's old steward and commands him, his 15 sons and 20 servants to farm the land for Mephibosheth. In a matter of hours, Mephibosheth's life is again turned around completely.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="47"><p>The best part is that God wants to do the same thing for you. He sees where you're at right now and is coming to pick you up and turn your situation around. You're in Lo Dabar right now, but it's not who you are. It's easy to blame someone/something for the situation you're currently in, but you can choose to not be the victim. The key is to admit we probably don't know it all, and probably can't get to the King's table on our own. That's where God's grace finds us, and brings us out of Lo Debar and to the King's table.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="48"><p>2 Corinthians 12:9 (New International Version)<br><em>But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."
